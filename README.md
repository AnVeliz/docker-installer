# docker-installer

![Build](https://github.com/AnVeliz/docker-installer/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)

The project's aim is to provide quite a flexible way to install and uninstall Docker (and may be something else in the future) on Linux and not to remember/looking for some commands. And mostly as my first Go project just for fun :smiley:

Supported OS:
Ubuntu 20.10
